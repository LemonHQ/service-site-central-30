    title: 'Expanding and standardizing motor insurance for a digital future',
    client: 'Liva',
    industry: 'Finance',
    services: ['Digitalize Product Lines', 'Expand Product Offerings', 'Standardize Digital Portfolio'],
    summary: 'Transforming a fragmented, 3rd party reliant model into a scalable, digital-first experience to unlock new reach, capabilities and influence',
    challenge: `<p><strong>Liva faced major hurdles in scaling its sales channels across direct customers, partners, and brokers.</strong> The existing experience was fragmented and inconsistent&mdash;separate portals served each segment, creating isolated silos. This setup made it costly and inefficient to roll out new features, offers, or capabilities, as each had to be implemented multiple times across different platforms.</p><p>Compounding the challenge was Liva&rsquo;s overreliance on third-party brokers for renewals. This not only made repeat business unpredictable but also prevented Liva from building direct relationships with policyholders. The lack of first-party data limited the brand&rsquo;s ability to make informed product or marketing decisions, while customer acquisition remained costly with minimal long-term impact.</p><p>For Liva&mdash;a multi-line insurer&mdash;owning the customer relationship was critical. It was the key to unlocking retention, enabling cross-sell opportunities, and staying ahead of digital-first competitors in an increasingly direct-to-customer market.</p>`,
    solution: `<p>A unified, modern experience that reimagined the entire motor insurance journey &mdash;standardizing across all customer segments while enabling full policy lifecycle management with flexibility to add new products and channels.&nbsp;</p><p><strong> Convenience at Scale </strong> : By integrating directly with the national vehicle licensing authority, customers could receive real-time quotes and complete purchases through a simplified two-step journey. One-click renewals and digital self-service options&mdash;such as canceling, transferring, or updating policies&mdash;were introduced for the first time, reducing dependency on offline channels and significantly improving customer convenience.</p>
                <p><strong> Control over the customer relationship. </strong> Policyholders could now renew directly with Liva instead of through brokers, enabling the insurer to retain repeat business and gather first-party data. With visibility, Liva could now target direct customers with precision and accuracy&mdash;driving acquisition efficiency and better campaign performance.</p>
                <p><strong> Expansion of distribution channels. </strong> Beyond D2C, it enabled Liva to expand its offerings to partners, brokers, and enterprise clients&mdash;all from the same standardized infrastructure. Existing relationships, such as with Omantel, were also leveraged&mdash;tailoring exclusive offerings for Omantel Green customers and enabling policy purchases using telecom credit lines and EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) options.&nbsp;</p>`,
    results: `<p>The modernization and expansion of Liva&rsquo;s platform delivered measurable impact across business outcomes - operations, growth, and customer engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Expanded customer base through direct renewals</strong><strong><br /></strong>A major outcome was the shift from broker-led to direct customer relationships. Many broker-acquired policyholders returned to renew directly with Liva, reducing acquisition costs and enabling the brand to build its own data-rich customer base.</p>
<p><strong>Access to underserved segments</strong><strong><br /></strong>By offering flexible payment options through Omantel and simplifying the digital journey, Liva reached new, previously underserved customer segments&mdash;broadening its market and driving long-term growth potential.</p>
<p><strong>Operational efficiencies through digitalization</strong><strong><br /></strong>Digitalizing policy lifecycle services streamlined internal processes, cut down manual workload, and accelerated turnaround times across quoting, renewal, and servicing. Sales teams were able to pursue leads and close more deals quicker.</p>
<p><strong>Enhanced customer experience</strong><strong><br /></strong>The self-service platform delivered a frictionless experience&mdash;making it easier for customers to manage policies end-to-end. This increased satisfaction, loyalty, and repeat engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-channel scalability:</strong><strong><br /></strong>With support for enterprise clients, brokers, and direct sales from a single platform, Liva scaled its reach efficiently&mdash;enabling new business models and revenue streams without added complexity.</p>`,
