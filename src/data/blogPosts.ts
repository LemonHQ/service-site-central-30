                  In a recent report from Adobe Analytics, search traffic to US retail websites from Generative AI sources has jumped 1,200%. Generative AI has moved from novelty to a mainstream tool that millions now use to find information &ndash; including recommendations on brands, services, and products. ChatGPT reached 1 million users in just five days and now draws over 400 million monthly users, illustrating how rapidly consumers have embraced AI assistants. This surge is massively disrupting how people search and discover products online.&nbsp;

                <p>
                  Crucially, it&rsquo;s not just Google&rsquo;s realm anymore: users are turning to conversational AI platforms like OpenAI&rsquo;s ChatGPT, Google&rsquo;s upcoming Gemini, Meta&rsquo;s Llama 2, and even Amazon&rsquo;s new &ldquo;Rufus&rdquo; AI assistant for shopping. In regulated sectors such as finance, insurance, and healthcare &ndash; where trust and accurate information are paramount &ndash; generative AI is already transforming how consumers find and evaluate offerings.

                <p>
                  One notable change is that
                  <strong>
                    the buying journey is becoming an interactive conversation
                  </strong>
                  . Instead of performing one-off searches, consumers are engaging in extended back-and-forth dialogues with AI chatbots throughout the buying funnel. As one industry expert observes, shoppers are now having &ldquo;a series of questions through the entire customer journey or purchase funnel&rdquo; with AI, rather than a single query-and-click &ndash; an
                  <strong>
                    iterative conversation
                  </strong>
                  that guides their decisions step by step. For example, a consumer might start by asking a chatbot which product category fits their needs, then inquire about specific features, compare alternatives, and finally confirm the best choice. This conversational approach keeps the AI assistant &ldquo;between the brand and the individual, basically guiding the conversation about the product&rdquo; as the consumer moves toward a purchase. In practical terms, an AI assistant can educate the buyer on product specs, clarify usage questions, and even handle objections in real time, much like a personal shopping advisor available 24/7.

                  Recent upgrades (late 2024&ndash; early 2025)&nbsp;
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Many of the consumer-facing AI tools got significant improvements in 2024&ndash;2025 that make them even more useful for product research and recommendations:

                    <strong>
                      OpenAI ChatGPT Gets Web Browsing &amp; Plugins (2024):
                    </strong>
                    Originally, ChatGPT&rsquo;s knowledge cut off in 2021, limiting its usefulness for new products. In 2024, OpenAI re-enabled and enhanced ChatGPT&rsquo;s
                    <strong>
                      web browsing capability
                    </strong>
                    , allowing it to pull current information from the internet when needed. This means ChatGPT can now fetch the latest data &ndash; for instance, 2024&rsquo;s newest insurance plans or current interest rates &ndash; instead of relying solely on its training data. OpenAI also expanded the plugin ecosystem, which includes plugins for shopping (e.g. Instacart, Klarna) that let ChatGPT search product databases in real time. These upgrades make ChatGPT far more adept at
                    <strong>
                      product discovery tasks
                    </strong>
                    , from finding up-to-date prices to checking if a particular item is in stock or if a new financial product has launched.

                    <strong>
                      Google&rsquo;s Gemini AI integrated into Search (late 2024):
                    </strong>
                    Google&rsquo;s next-gen LLM
                    <strong>
                      Gemini
                    </strong>
                    (the successor to PaLM 2) was custom-built to enhance search. By late 2024, Google confirmed that Gemini is being used to generate richer answers in SGE. Gemini&rsquo;s multimodal and reasoning abilities allow it to handle more complex queries. At Google I/O 2024, the company demonstrated how AI could answer entirely new types of questions that search engines struggled with before. For example, you can describe an intricate need (&ldquo;I need a gift for a 10-year-old who loves astronomy and dinosaurs&rdquo;) and the AI can parse that and suggest creative product ideas. In 2025, Google also expanded
                    <strong>
                      AI summaries to more healthcare queries
                    </strong>
                    and introduced features like comparative overlays for medical information, showing their commitment to domain-specific improvements. All these updates aim to make the AI results more accurate, comprehensive, and trustworthy &ndash; critical for regulated fields.

                      Amazon&rsquo;s Rufus Fully Deployed (2024):
                    </strong>
                    After a testing period,
                    <strong>
                      Amazon&rsquo;s Rufus shopping AI was rolled out to all US customers in September 2024
                    </strong>
                    . Throughout 2024, Amazon improved Rufus&rsquo;s ability to handle a broad range of shopping questions. By analyzing
                    <strong>
                      product manuals, customer reviews, and even community Q&amp;A content
                    </strong>
                    , Rufus became better at answering detailed product questions (e.g. compatibility concerns, ingredient safety in cosmetics). Amazon also reports refining Rufus with feedback from
                    <strong>
                      tens of millions of customer interactions
                    </strong>
                    . This feedback loop helped the AI provide more relevant recommendations. For instance, if users frequently ask whether a certain mascara is a &ldquo;clean beauty&rdquo; product, Rufus learns to proactively mention product safety or ingredient info. By 2025, Amazon predicts its AI assistant will significantly boost customer engagement and sales &ndash; an internal projection even estimated a
                    <strong>
                      $700M profit impact
                    </strong>
                    from Rufus, as more shoppers find what they need faster.

                    Smaller AI search players continued to innovate.
                    <strong>
                      Perplexity introduced features like &ldquo;internal knowledge search&rdquo; and community sharing (Spaces) in late 2024
                    </strong>
                    . These allow users to trust it not just for public web info but also for personal or proprietary data (think of uploading a PDF of your insurance policy and asking questions about it). While not specific to one industry, such features can be extremely useful in regulated domains &ndash; e.g. a doctor could upload clinical guidelines and have the AI answer questions, or a financial advisor could query an AI on internal research documents. Additionally,
                    <strong>
                      Microsoft&rsquo;s AI Co-pilot integration
                    </strong>
                    across Windows and Office (late 2023) means more users have an AI at their fingertips, which could be used to search the web or internal data without opening a browserfile-ckvpyd2l5rg2rkvp7c74dq. Apple is also rebuilding Siri with generative AI capabilitiesfile-ckvpyd2l5rg2rkvp7c74dq &ndash; we may soon see voice-driven product queries (like asking your iPhone,

                  <br />
                  The upshot of these upgrades is that consumers in 2025 expect
                  <strong>
                    fast, personalized answers

                  In finance, insurance, and healthcare, consumers are beginning to use these platforms to get answers that were once provided by advisors, agents, or curated search results. Below, we explore specific use cases and implications in these sectors.

                  Financial Services (Banking &amp; Investment)
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Consumers are using AI chatbots to seek quick financial advice and product recommendations in a conversational way. Instead of parsing fine print on bank websites, a user might ask an AI assistant:
                  <em>
                    &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the best savings account for high interest rates?&rdquo;
                  </em>
                  or
                  <em>
                    &ldquo;How do I apply for a mortgage?&rdquo;
                  </em>
                  <img src="/assets/imgs/Best credit card for students.png" />
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>
                      Product Comparisons:
                    </strong>
                    A generative AI can instantly compare financial products. For example, Google&rsquo;s AI Overview might summarize
                    <em>
                      &ldquo;how to apply for a mortgage&rdquo;
                    </em>
                    with step-by-step guidance and even list AI-generated snippets of the
                    <strong>
                      nearest bank branches or loan officers
                    </strong>
                    if relevant. Under the new SGE, a query like that yields an AI answer explaining the process, whereas previously a user had to click a bank&rsquo;s website or a how-to article. In side-by-side tests, the generative result often provides the needed info
                    <strong>
                      with zero clicks
                    </strong>
                    to external sites. Similarly, asking
                    <em>
                      &ldquo;Which is better: a 15-year vs 30-year mortgage?&rdquo;
                    </em>
                    in ChatGPT or Bard can produce a detailed comparison, something that used to require reading several blog posts.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>
                      Credit Cards and Loans:
                    </strong>
                    AI assistants are being used to evaluate consumer finance products. A user could query,
                    <em>
                      &ldquo;Find me the top 3 travel credit cards with low annual fees,&rdquo;
                    </em>
                    and the AI will likely enumerate a few card options, citing their perks and fees.
                    <strong>
                      ChatGPT tends to give very straightforward, advisory answers
                    </strong>
                    in finance, and research shows it can even rival traditional robo-advisors in certain advice scenarios (though with caveats). That said, platforms often include disclaimers for financial queries. Forbes analysts warn users
                    <strong>
                      not to blindly trust ChatGPT for financial product recommendations
                    </strong>
                    yet, as it doesn&rsquo;t know one&rsquo;s personal situation. Still, the convenience is attractive &ndash; especially for general questions like banking terminology, how to open an account, or comparing interest rates.

                  <li>
                    <strong>
                      Personal Finance Guidance:
                    </strong>
                    Beyond specific products, generative AI can educate consumers on financial strategies. For instance, people are asking ChatGPT things like
                    <em>
                      &ldquo;How can I improve my credit score?&rdquo;
                    </em>
                    or
                    <em>
                      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s a 401(k) and should I use one?&rdquo;
                    </em>
                    and getting digestible answers. This may not point them to a particular brand immediately, but it shapes their criteria for later choosing a provider (e.g. learning that
                    <em>
                      low-fee investment funds
                    </em>
                    are good, so they then seek brands offering those). Banks and investment firms are starting to notice this indirect influence on customers&rsquo; decisions. Some institutions have begun integrating AI chat on their own sites to answer customer queries with approved information, hoping to keep the user from going out to a third-party AI which might give mixed results.

                </h3>
                <p>
                  Insurance products are complex and often not well understood by consumers &ndash; a perfect scenario for AI guidance. Users are beginning to lean on generative AI to demystify policies and providers:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>
                      Product recommendation:
                    </strong>
                    Rather than calling an insurance agent, someone might ask an AI,
                    <em>
                      &ldquo;What insurance do I need as a freelancer?&rdquo;
                    </em>
                    The assistant could outline necessary coverage (health, disability, liability, etc.) and even list popular insurers or plans that fit the profile. Early experiments with AI search in insurance show a
                    <strong>
                      &ldquo;high impact&rdquo; of generative answers on this sector&rsquo;s queries
                    </strong>
                    &ndash; meaning many insurance-related searches yield an AI summary. For example, a query about
                    <em>
                      &ldquo;best car insurance for new drivers&rdquo;
                    </em>
                    might prompt an AI to list a few insurers known for good youth driver rates, summarizing each. These answers typically draw from online reviews, consumer surveys, and state insurance filings (data that AI can ingest from its training).

                      Complex coverage questions:
                    </strong>
                    Insurance is filled with &ldquo;it depends&rdquo; scenarios, and AI chat is surprisingly adept at handling these nuances through conversation. A user could ask,
                    <em>
                      &ldquo;Does my travel insurance cover trip cancellation due to illness?&rdquo;
                    </em>
                    and get a tailored explanation, possibly followed by
                    <em>
                      &ldquo;What are some insurers that offer robust trip cancellation coverage?&rdquo;
                    </em>
                    The AI might cite a few top-rated plans. In the past, the user would have to read policy PDFs or trust an agent; now the AI acts as an
                    <strong>
                      initial filter and educator
                    </strong>
                    . Of course, it may not know the specifics of
                    <em>
                      your
                    </em>
                    policy unless you feed it, but it can speak generally.

                    Generative AI in search also affects how local insurance providers get discovered. If someone searches

                    <strong>
                      the results may highlight different providers with AI-generated descriptions rather than the usual list of web pages
                    </strong>
                    , depending on query intent. Likewise, ChatGPT might not give a local agency name offhand (since its training data skews to larger entities), but as these models integrate real-time data, even smaller insurers with strong local reviews could surface via AI recommendations.

                <p>
                  Insurance being highly regulated means any incorrect answer about coverage can be risky. The AI platforms usually have safeguards, but mistakes can happen (e.g. misunderstanding a coverage clause). Still, consumers appear eager to use these tools for quick answers, and insurers are beginning to incorporate vetted AI bots in customer service. We are likely to see more specialized insurance chatbots (trained on policy wordings and state regulations) that plug into bigger assistant platforms.

                  Healthcare is one of the most impacted industries in this AI search revolution &ndash;
                  <strong>
                    analysts found that healthcare queries see &ldquo;extreme&rdquo; levels of AI-generated answers in Google&rsquo;s SGE
                  </strong>
                  , more than any other category. Both patients and providers are using generative AI to find medical information, which directly influences healthcare brand discovery (hospitals, clinics, medications, etc.):

                    <strong>
                      Symptom and treatment searches:
                    </strong>
                    Patients often search symptoms or treatment options before deciding on care. Now, asking an AI,
                    <em>
                      &ldquo;How is Type 2 diabetes treated?&rdquo;
                    </em>
                    might yield an organized answer describing diet, exercise, medications (with drug brand names), and possibly mention leading healthcare providers or programs. Google recently announced it is expanding
                    <strong>
                      AI summaries to thousands more health topics
                    </strong>
                    &ndash; for instance, a search about a chronic condition could show an
                    <strong>
                      AI-crafted overview with medical facts and even patient anecdotes
                    </strong>
                    . One new feature called
                    <em>
                      &ldquo;What People Suggest&rdquo;
                    </em>
                    uses generative AI to compile snippets of online patient discussions for those with similar diagnoses. So if you search a specific condition, you might see
                    <em>
                      common tips from other patients
                    </em>
                    (e.g.
                    <em>
                      &ldquo;Others with arthritis suggest these exercises&rdquo;
                    </em>
                    ). This kind of crowd-sourced summary was never available in traditional search, and it can influence which treatments or wellness products a patient considers.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>
                      Health Product Recommendations:
                    </strong>
                    Consumers also use AI to discover health-related products (supplements, medical devices, insurance plans). For example,
                    <em>
                      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s a good over-the-counter allergy medicine that won&rsquo;t cause drowsiness?&rdquo;
                    </em>
                    could get an answer listing a couple of antihistamine brands with rationale. Or someone might ask,
                    <em>
                      &ldquo;Which fitness tracker is best for heart health monitoring?&rdquo;
                    </em>
                    and get a comparison of wearables. These are effectively product discovery questions that now bypass traditional search ads and review sites. The AI will glean from reviews, specifications, and expert articles to present a few options. Given the sensitivity around medical advice, platforms like Bard and ChatGPT usually couch suggestions with caution (
                    <em>
                      &ldquo;Consult a healthcare professional&hellip;
                    </em>
                    &rdquo;), but they often do provide substantive info that can lead a user toward certain brands or solutions.

                <p>
                  Google&rsquo;s own data showed a heavy uptake of AI answers in health queries, and it&rsquo;s actively tuning this feature. For example,
                  <strong>
                    Google&rsquo;s AI can now compare complex health information
                  </strong>
                  (like showing side-by-side info on different illnesses or treatments), something that can heavily influence a patient&rsquo;s perception of treatment options.

                <h2>
                  Why brands must monitor, track AI-generated results
                </h2>
                <p>
                  For brands in finance, insurance, and healthcare, the rise of generative AI in discovery is a double-edged sword: it presents new opportunities to reach customers, but also risks if you&rsquo;re not represented accurately. AI assistants can become the
                  <strong>
                    &ldquo;source of truth&rdquo;
                  </strong>
                  about your brand for consumers who use them. This makes it vital to actively monitor, measure and track your company or products in AI-driven conversations and search results.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>
                    Consider the new customer journey:
                  </strong>
                  Instead of clicking your carefully crafted website or a listing you paid for, a consumer might hear about you from an AI&rsquo;s summary. If the AI says
                  <em>
                    &ldquo;Policy ABC has slow claim approvals&rdquo;
                  </em>
                  or
                  <em>
                    &ldquo;Clinic XYZ is top-rated for cardiac care&rdquo;
                  </em>
                  , those statements can make or break a customer decision &ndash; and they often come with no immediate ability for you to rebut or elaborate (unlike on your own site or social media). Therefore:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>
                      Monitor AI outputs regularly:
                    </strong>
                    It&rsquo;s important to
                    <strong>
                      treat AI answers as a new type of &ldquo;search result&rdquo; to monitor
                    </strong>
                    . Just as companies track their Google search rankings or social media mentions, they should now be checking what ChatGPT, Bing Chat, Bard, etc., say about them. This could mean literally asking the AI,
                    <em>
                      &ldquo;What is your opinion of [my company]?&rdquo;
                    </em>
                    or
                    <em>
                      &ldquo;Which [product type] do you recommend and why?&rdquo;
                    </em>
                    and seeing if your brand appears and how it&rsquo;s described. Some AI platforms cite sources &ndash; follow those links to see where the information is coming from. If an AI summary cites a years-old article or an inaccurate forum comment, you may need to engage in some PR or content updates to correct the record at the source.
                    <strong>
                      Tools will emerge for &ldquo;AI reputation monitoring,&rdquo;
                    </strong>
                    but even now, manually querying these systems can be eye-opening. Remember, AI models also have training data that may not update instantly with the web &ndash; if you changed a policy in 2023 but the AI was trained on 2021 info, it might be telling people outdated details. Knowing this, you might publish fresh content or press releases emphasizing the new info, increasing the chances the AI picks it up when using its browsing or updated models.

                      Embrace AI on owned channels:
                    </strong>
                    Brands shouldn&rsquo;t just react to others&rsquo; AI &ndash; they can deploy their own. Many banks, insurers, and healthcare providers are starting to use
                    <strong>
                      GPT-powered chatbots on their websites or apps
                    </strong>
                    to guide customers. These can be tuned to provide
                    <em>
                      compliant, up-to-date
                    </em>
                    info and can hand off to human agents when needed. Not only does this improve customer experience, it also feeds the broader AI ecosystem: the more people directly get answers from a brand&rsquo;s AI (with approved messaging), the less likely they&rsquo;ll rely on an external AI that might be less accurate. In regulated industries, compliance-approved AI assistants could become a competitive advantage, serving as both a helpful tool and a form of content dissemination (for instance, a user might share &ldquo;My bank&rsquo;s chatbot told me X about mortgages&rdquo; &ndash; effectively spreading your narrative).

                  <strong>
                    Brands in finance, insurance, and healthcare should treat AI platforms as the new battleground for customer mindshare.
                  </strong>
                  By monitoring AI outputs and adapting strategies accordingly, you can ensure that when an AI agent guides a consumer through a financial decision or health query, your brand is accurately and favorably represented.&nbsp;

            Introduction: The New Digital Imperative
          </h2>
          <p>
            In an era of rapidly shifting consumer behavior, traditional enterprise brands are under pressure to reinvent themselves for the digital age. The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically accelerated online commerce &ndash; U.S. e-commerce sales jumped 44% in 2020 alone &ndash; and consumers across all demographics have grown comfortable shopping online. More importantly, customers now expect richer, direct engagement with brands and seamless experiences across channels. This has prompted many established companies to experiment with direct-to-consumer (D2C) models, looking beyond their legacy retail channels to capture new value. As one industry observer noted, if brands master e-commerce and logistics to deliver fast, convenient service, they can &ldquo;build brands, grow margins and sell on a site filled with their products&rdquo; &ndash; but if they fail, they risk damaging their reputation. In short, going digital and D2C is no longer optional; it&rsquo;s a strategic imperative for survival and growth.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet transforming into a digital- and D2C-driven business is no easy feat for legacy enterprises. This article explores the structural and operational challenges that hold traditional brands back, and the strategic shifts required to embrace digital-first customer experiences. It is tailored for brand, product, and digital leaders seeking practical insights on how to capture new forms of value through D2C strategies and better meet evolving customer needs. We&rsquo;ll also highlight examples of heritage brands navigating this transformation &ndash; from North America to Europe &ndash; and discuss the importance of agility, personalization, data infrastructure, and omnichannel capabilities in scaling digital portfolios successfully.

            Old Structures vs. New Realities: key challenges for legacy Brands
          </h2>
          <p>
            For many incumbent brands, the journey to digital maturity and D2C adoption is fraught with internal hurdles. Several structural and operational challenges commonly stand in the way:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>
                Outdated legacy systems:
              </strong>
              Established companies often run on aging IT systems and fragmented architectures that were built for a brick-and-mortar era. These legacy systems and siloed databases make it hard to share data and integrate new digital tools. In many cases, systems evolved organically in different divisions and lack common standards, creating an inflexible tech stack that
              <strong>
                hinders fast integrations and data flow
              </strong>
              . Such technical debt can severely limit a brand&rsquo;s ability to deliver modern digital experiences.

                Internal silos:
              </strong>
              Organizational silos are another major barrier. Traditional enterprises frequently have multiple product lines, products channels and markets that don&rsquo;t necessarily collaborate or share customer information across their portfolios. Siloed teams might optimize for their own channel (POS, partners, or online) rather than the end-to-end customer journey. This leads to disjointed experiences and slow execution. Breaking down these silos is difficult in companies used to clear-cut hierachial roles and legacy KPIs.

                Cultural inertia and resistance to change:

              Perhaps the biggest obstacle is
              <strong>
                organizational inertia
              </strong>
              . Leaders and employees at legacy firms may intellectually want digital transformation, but in practice they resist change to established routines and business models. As one digital transformation expert put it,
              <em>
                &ldquo;everybody wants change, but nobody wants to change.&rdquo;
              </em>
              Resistance can come from employees, managers, or even board members who prefer the status. Many fear short-term disruptions: for example, sales teams worry D2C efforts will cannibalize the existing wholesale business or anger long-time retail partners. Indeed, large consumer brands historically shied away from D2C for fear of channel conflict and upsetting retailers. This cautious culture can slow down decision-making and experimentation to a crawl.

                Processes not built for direct engagement:
              </strong>
              Traditional enterprises are optimized for scale and efficiency, not the agility that digital channels demand. Their supply chains ship pallets to store distribution centers, not single packages to individual doorsteps. Their marketing teams excel at broad campaigns, not one-to-one personalized messaging. Shifting to D2C requires retooling these processes. For example, fulfillment costs and operations need rethinking &ndash; instead of truckloads to retailers, companies must figure out how to
              <em>
                efficiently deliver individual orders to homes
              </em>
              . Customer service and returns handling must ramp up to serve end-consumers directly. These operational pivots can strain organizations that have never done it before.

          </ul>
          <p>
            Taken together, these legacy challenges can make it feel like turning a tanker ship to steer a big brand toward digital. It&rsquo;s no wonder research finds
            <strong>
              70% of digital transformations fall short of their objectives
            </strong>
            . However, the cost of inaction is even higher. Upstart D2C competitors and &ldquo;attacker&rdquo; brands are moving fast and eating away at market share in many categories by leveraging modern tools and business models. Traditional brands must confront their internal barriers and evolve, or else face irrelevance. The good news is that by acknowledging these challenges, companies can start to address them head-on &ndash; and unlock significant new value in the process.

          </h2>
          <p>
            Why should a legacy brand go through the pain of embracing D2C? Simply put, a well-executed D2C strategy can unlock
            <strong>
              powerful new forms of value
            </strong>
            that traditional retail channels cannot match. A Boston Consulting Group analysis summed it up: a D2C channel (when done right) allows a company to
            <strong>
              &ldquo;collect valuable consumer data, personalize the experience, quickly launch and test new products, and grow the business.&rdquo;
            </strong>
            In other words, D2C opens the door to capabilities that are increasingly critical in today&rsquo;s consumer markets. Here are some of the key benefits and value drivers for brands:

                First-Party customer data and insights:
              </strong>
              D2C interactions provide something that selling through middlemen never could &ndash; a direct data link to the end customer. When a consumer buys from a brand&rsquo;s own website or app, the company can gather rich data about that customer&rsquo;s preferences, behavior, and feedback. Over time this builds a trove of first-party data that can inform everything from product development to marketing strategy. For example,
              <strong>
                Levi Strauss &amp; Co.
              </strong>
              found that its pivot to D2C (through its own stores and site) generated a wealth of data enabling
              <em>
                &ldquo;faster, even predictive responses&rdquo;
              </em>
              to customer trends. By analyzing its D2C data, Levi&rsquo;s gained better insight into emerging preferences &ndash; like a shift toward casualwear and looser fits &ndash; and could adjust production and inventory accordingly. In fact, this feedback loop has allowed Levi&rsquo;s to cut product development cycles by up to
              <strong>
                50%
              </strong>
              in some cases. The direct customer link is turning into a primary source of consumer insight for many brands.

                Personalized Customer Experiences:
              </strong>
              Hand-in-hand with data comes the ability to personalize. Through D2C channels, brands can tailor the experience to individual customers in ways that mass retail simply can&rsquo;t. This might mean personalized product recommendations, targeted content, or custom promotions based on a shopper&rsquo;s history and interests.
              <strong>
                Nike
              </strong>
              provides a great example &ndash; the sportswear giant has invested heavily in digital membership programs and apps to personalize engagement. Nearly
              <strong>
                70% of Nike&rsquo;s digital sales now come from members
              </strong>
              who use its apps, where they receive tailored offers (like early access to new sneakers) and content aligned to their preferences. Nike uses data science to send precision marketing messages via its SNKRS app, factoring in each member&rsquo;s engagement and past purchase attempts. This kind of one-to-one personalization drives higher conversion and loyalty. More broadly, D2C lets brands craft a
              <strong>
                cohesive omnichannel journey
              </strong>
              &ndash; they can recognize the same customer as she moves from a website to a mobile app to a physical store, and ensure consistent, personalized treatment throughout.

                Agility in product development and marketing:
              </strong>
              D2C channels give brands a sandbox to
              <strong>
                launch and test new ideas quickly
              </strong>
              with real customers. Instead of persuading a retailer to stock a new product and waiting months for sales data, a company can drop a limited release on its own site and get immediate feedback. This agility accelerates innovation cycles. BCG observes that leading companies use D2C platforms to pilot
              <em>
                &ldquo;new innovative products on a smaller scale with a faster time to market, then adjust based on consumer feedback.&rdquo;
              </em>
              If a concept resonates, it can be scaled up; if not, the company can fail fast with minimal losses. D2C also enables agile marketing &ndash; brands can run micro-campaigns or A/B test messages directly with their audience, something much harder to do when the customer relationship is owned by a retailer. During the 2020 lockdowns, for instance,
              <strong>
                PepsiCo
              </strong>
              spun up two D2C websites (Snacks.com and PantryShop.com) in just 30 days to respond to sudden shifts in demand. That rapid experiment, aimed at
              <em>
                &ldquo;quickly meet[ing] consumers&rsquo; evolving needs&rdquo;
              </em>
              , was a radical departure from the slow, big-wholesale way of operating. It showcased how a traditionally B2B2C company could act in an agile, startup-like fashion via a direct channel.

                Greater margin and control:
              </strong>
              Selling direct also means cutting out the retail middleman, which can improve margins (or at least protect margins under pressure). Brands have more control over pricing and promotions in D2C &ndash; no need to worry about a retailer marking down your product without notice. As BCG notes, owning the &ldquo;storefront&rdquo; frees brands from adjacent competitors or private labels driving down prices, allowing them to set price and pack sizes as they see fit. D2C can thus be margin accretive, especially for premium brands. It also gives full control over merchandising and brand presentation. A company&rsquo;s own site or store can showcase the
              <strong>
                full breadth of the product range
              </strong>
              (not just what a third-party buyer selects) and present it in a brand-authentic way. Levi&rsquo;s, for example, uses its D2C channels to highlight a wider assortment and cross-promote categories that might be overlooked in a crowded department store rack. This control over the brand experience can strengthen brand equity in the long run.

                New revenue streams and business models:
              </strong>
              D2C opens the door to revenue streams beyond traditional one-time sales. Many brands are experimenting with
              <strong>
                subscriptions, memberships, and services
              </strong>
              as part of their D2C portfolio. A classic example is
              <strong>
                Peloton
              </strong>
              , which turned exercise equipment into a subscription platform &ndash; about 20% of Peloton&rsquo;s revenue now comes from subscriptions, with a
              <strong>
                93% retention rate
              </strong>
              , and analysts attribute up to 85% of the company&rsquo;s valuation to its subscription business (versus hardware sales). While not every brand will emulate Peloton, traditional product companies are indeed bundling services or loyalty programs to create recurring revenue. We see consumer goods giants offering subscription boxes (e.g. grooming products, meal kits) and memberships with perks for buying direct. These models not only provide steady income but also deepen customer engagement (for instance, members of Nike&rsquo;s loyalty program shop more frequently and at higher value). Additionally, brands can monetize their direct relationship through upsells like customization &ndash;
              <strong>
                Coca-Cola&rsquo;s &ldquo;Share a Coke&rdquo; D2C program
              </strong>
              is a famous case where consumers pay a premium for personalized Coke bottles ordered online. In short, D2C channels let brands be creative in how they deliver value to customers (and capture value back).

                Alignment with evolving customer expectations:
              </strong>
              Last but not least, a D2C strategy aligns companies with how today&rsquo;s customers increasingly prefer to shop. Modern consumers expect
              <strong>
                convenience, speed, and connection
              </strong>
              . They want to buy when and how it&rsquo;s easiest for them &ndash; whether that means on their phone at midnight or via a social media shop &ndash; and they gravitate toward brands that offer a smooth, direct relationship. The pandemic only cemented these expectations, as many people discovered the ease of ordering straight from brands. As BCG put it, D2C
              <em>
                &ldquo;aligns with the way many consumers want to interact with brands.&rdquo;
              </em>
              Even in categories that long relied on in-person retail (from grocery to luxury fashion), more consumers now seek out direct online options. By meeting customers where they are &ndash; and providing the kind of personalized, engaging experience they seek &ndash; traditional brands can stay relevant and even increase loyalty. In fact, a well-run D2C channel can enhance a brand&rsquo;s relationship with its customers in ways that wholesale channels never could, building community and advocacy over time.

          <p>
            Unlocking these D2C benefits requires more than launching a brand or product online &ndash; it demands fundamental shifts in strategy, culture, and operations. Traditional enterprises must
            <strong>
              reinvent themselves as digital-first, customer-centric organizations
            </strong>
            . The following strategic priorities are key for brand, product, and digital leaders aiming to foster true digital-native customer experiences:
          </p>
          <ul>

                Put the customer (and Data) at the center:
              </strong>
              Legacy companies need to shift from a channel-driven mindset to a
              <strong>
                customer-centric mindset
              </strong>
              . This means mapping out the customer journey across all touchpoints and identifying pain points and opportunities to delight the customer. Every decision &ndash; whether introducing a new digital feature or reworking a policy &ndash; should start with &ldquo;How does this improve the customer experience?&rdquo; In practice, being customer-centric today is heavily data-driven. Companies must invest in capturing and analyzing customer data from every source (online interactions, in-store visits, customer service calls, etc.) to gain a 360-degree view. A solid data infrastructure is crucial: data should be unified, shareable, and fit for purpose across the organization. Brands like Nike have gone so far as to acquire data analytics firms to boost their personalization and demand-sensing capabilities. The end goal is to use data insights to continually optimize the experience &ndash; for example, using real-time customer feedback to tweak a website UI, or leveraging purchase history to curate a more relevant product assortment for each user. Customer-centric, data-informed decision making may require new tools (CRM systems, customer data platforms) and new skills (data scientists, analysts), but it forms the foundation of any successful digital transformation.

              <strong>
                internal silos have to be dismantled
              </strong>
              . Brands should encourage much tighter collaboration between traditionally separate functions &ndash; e.g. e-commerce, IT, marketing, supply chain, and store operations need to work in concert. Many organizations are establishing cross-functional &ldquo;digital venture&rdquo; teams or D2C business units with end-to-end responsibility, cutting across departmental lines. Others integrate digital objectives into every team&rsquo;s goals so that everyone is rowing in the same direction. The organizational structure may need updating as well: for instance, creating a Chief Digital Officer role or digital task forces that report directly to top leadership can help break through bureaucracy. The bottom line is that serving a digital-native customer often requires
              <strong>
                blurring the old boundaries
              </strong>
              &ndash; the marketing team might coordinate with IT daily to implement a new personalization feature, or the product development team might rely on analytics from the digital team to decide on a new offering. Companies must foster a culture of collaboration and information sharing, replacing the old silo mentality with a shared mission around customer experience.

                Foster an agile, learning culture:
              </strong>
              Traditional brands have to overcome their cultural inertia by instilling a culture that rewards agility and innovation. This is a significant change management effort. Leadership must actively champion the digital agenda and help employees see the personal benefit in embracing change. One approach is to start with
              <strong>
                &ldquo;lighthouse&rdquo; digital projects
              </strong>
              that demonstrate quick wins, helping convert skeptics as they see positive results. Additionally, companies should empower teams to experiment without fear of failure. In a digital context, not every new idea will work &ndash; and that&rsquo;s okay, as long as you
              <em>
                learn and iterate
              </em>
              . Adopting agile methodologies (scrum teams, sprints, rapid prototyping) can structure this experimentation. For example, a D2C team might run a series of A/B tests on a website banner or launch a limited pilot of a new service, then iterate based on metrics. To make this possible, decision-making can&rsquo;t be business-as-usual; teams need the autonomy to make changes quickly. At successful transformers,
              <strong>
                decisions and investments are made in weeks, not months
              </strong>
              . Hierarchies are flattened and employees are
              <em>
                &ldquo;empowered to suggest and implement digital solutions&rdquo;
              </em>
              at all levels. Upskilling and recruiting are also part of the puzzle &ndash; brands may need to hire experienced e-commerce managers, UX designers, data engineers, etc., and provide extensive training to existing staff to build a digitally savvy workforce. The goal is a nimble organization that responds to market feedback in real time, rather than sticking to annual planning cycles.

                Modernize technology and infrastructure:
              </strong>
              A modern digital customer experience rests on modern technology. Thus, legacy brands must be willing to
              <strong>
                upgrade their infrastructure
              </strong>
              and integrate new platforms. This could mean migrating off an old ERP that doesn&rsquo;t interface with e-commerce systems, adopting a scalable cloud-based commerce platform, or implementing APIs to connect previously siloed systems. In some cases, it requires identifying which legacy systems
              <em>
                &ldquo;are not worth retrofitting&rdquo;
              </em>
              &ndash; accumulating technical debt will only hinder your ability to scale digitally. Instead, companies should replace or re-architect those components in line with their transformation goals. Many firms are now adopting microservices and headless architecture for flexibility, as well as leveraging SaaS tools for quick deployment of capabilities (for instance, using a third-party logistics partner to handle D2C fulfillment rather than building it all in-house at the start). Data architecture is equally important: investing in a robust data pipeline and governance ensures that insights can flow freely and be trusted across the enterprise. The technology modernization should enable two critical things:
              <strong>
                omnichannel integration
              </strong>
              and
              <strong>
                personalization at scale
              </strong>
              . Omnichannel integration means a customer&rsquo;s activities on the mobile app, website, and physical store are all connected (e.g. the ability to buy online and return in-store, or an associate in-store having access to the customer&rsquo;s online wishlist). Personalization at scale means the systems can deliver individualized content/recommendations to millions of customers simultaneously &ndash; which often involves AI and real-time decision engines crunching all that customer data. Legacy IT environments may struggle with these tasks, so a deliberate tech transformation roadmap is needed. While this requires capital investment, the payoff is enabling the kind of experiences digital-native consumers expect.

                orchestrating channels to work together
              </strong>
              in a complementary way. Customers should experience a brand, not a channel &ndash; whether they&rsquo;re on Instagram, the brand&rsquo;s website, or in a mall. Therefore, traditional brands need to develop true omnichannel capabilities. This might include unifying inventory across channels (so that an online order can be fulfilled from a store, or a store purchase can be delivered to home if not in stock locally), and linking loyalty programs so that shoppers earn and redeem rewards whether they buy in person or online. Many leading retailers and brands in North America and Europe have rolled out services like curbside pickup, buy-online-pickup-in-store (BOPIS), or ship-from-store to blend online convenience with offline immediacy. Importantly, omnichannel strategy also entails consistent messaging &ndash; for example, a customer who abandons an online cart might receive a follow-up email and also see a related offer next time they open the brand&rsquo;s mobile app or visit a store kiosk. Achieving this consistency requires internal coordination (tying back to breaking silos) and often a single view of the customer through data integration. European fashion retailer
              <strong>
                Zara (Inditex)
              </strong>
              , for instance, invested in integrating its online and physical stock systems, enabling services like in-store pickup and making the shopping journey more fluid. Similarly, Levi&rsquo;s expanded its
              <strong>
                Red Tab loyalty program
              </strong>
              to Europe with a unified approach so that customers earn points and get personalized offers across both Levi&rsquo;s stores and its e-commerce site. The companies that get omnichannel right create a seamless experience where the customer hardly notices which channel they are in at any given moment &ndash; they can discover on social media, buy online, exchange in store, etc., all with ease. This is a significant shift from the siloed channel strategies of the past, but it&rsquo;s increasingly what consumers expect.

              </strong>
              Finally, a strategic shift is to adopt a more
              <strong>
                experimental, metrics-driven approach
              </strong>
              to scaling new initiatives. Traditional enterprises often bet big on ideas and roll them out on a large scale (due to historically needing scale for retail distribution). In the digital world, it&rsquo;s usually smarter to start small, prove the concept, and then scale up quickly if successful. Leaders should encourage a test-and-learn mentality: set hypotheses, define KPIs (e.g. conversion rate, customer acquisition cost, lifetime value), and let the data guide the next steps. If an experiment shows positive signals, allocate more capital; if it underperforms, iterate or shut it down swiftly. This capital-efficient approach prevents huge sunk costs and keeps the organization responsive to market feedback. We saw this with the PepsiCo example &ndash; launching two D2C sites as a low-risk experiment during the pandemic, which could then be evaluated for long-term viability. Many CPG firms likewise tried D2C pilots (like Kraft Heinz&rsquo;s
              <strong>
                Heinz to Home
              </strong>
              in the UK) to gauge consumer interest; those that resonated are being continued or expanded. An insights-driven approach also means using analytics to spot trends or issues in real time &ndash; for instance, monitoring social media and customer reviews to catch early warning signs of changing preferences or product problems, then responding before it&rsquo;s too late. In essence, companies must become more
              <strong>
                externally aware and adaptable
              </strong>
              , tuning their strategies based on what the market is saying. The era of rigid five-year plans is over; in a fast-evolving digital landscape, continuous improvement and agility are the name of the game.

            <strong>
              Conclusion: thriving in a Direct-to-Consumer era
            </strong>
          </h2>
          <p>
            Traditional enterprises that successfully scale their digital portfolios and embrace D2C strategies position themselves to capture immense new value and stay relevant in a customer-driven era. They also future-proof their business against disruptors. The journey isn&rsquo;t easy &ndash; it demands breaking old habits, overhauling systems, and taking some calculated risks. Structural obstacles like legacy silos and cultural inertia are real, but as we&rsquo;ve seen, they can be overcome with strong leadership and a clear vision. The prize on the other side is a business that is
            <strong>
              far more in tune with its customers
            </strong>
            , more agile in responding to market shifts, and able to unlock revenue streams that simply weren&rsquo;t accessible in the purely wholesale model.
          </p>
          <p>
            For brand, product, and digital leaders, the mandate is to champion this transformation with a blend of boldness and pragmatism. That means setting a compelling digital vision and rallying the organization around it, while also delivering quick wins (like pilot projects or improved metrics) that build momentum and confidence. It means investing in the right technology and talent, but also rethinking processes and incentives to engrain a digital-first, customer-first philosophy. And it means continuously listening to customers and refining the approach &ndash; the work is never &ldquo;done&rdquo; in a fast-evolving digital landscape.
          </p>
          <p>
            The encouraging news is that even legacy brands can and have made the leap. Companies like Nike, Levi&rsquo;s, and others show that heritage can be an asset, not a hindrance, if coupled with innovation. These brands leveraged their strengths (strong brand equity, quality products) and amplified them through new digital channels and capabilities. By doing so, they are writing the playbook for how to remain cultural and market leaders in the 21st century. As one executive noted, D2C success for big brands
            <em>
              &ldquo;works best when brands are culturally relevant first&rdquo;
            </em>
            &ndash; established companies must ensure their brand still resonates, then use D2C to deepen that relevance with today&rsquo;s digitally savvy consumers.
          </p>
          <p>
            In conclusion, scaling digital is a challenging but rewarding path for traditional enterprises. Those that navigate the structural challenges and wholeheartedly embrace D2C will find themselves with more loyal customers, stronger control of their destiny, and new avenues for growth in an increasingly direct world. In the words of a recent industry analysis:
            <em>
              &ldquo;Adversity often provides opportunity &ndash; and DTC fits the bill here.&rdquo;
            </em>
            The opportunity is there for the taking, and the time to act is now. Brands that seize it and evolve will not only capture new forms of value, but also ensure they remain vibrant and competitive for decades to come.

      <p>For decades, marketers have chased the elusive "segment-of-one" - the ability to deliver truly personalized experiences to each individual consumer. What was once a distant aspiration is rapidly becoming reality as artificial intelligence and digital ecosystems converge to transform how businesses engage with their customers.</p>

      <h2>Beyond Basic Personalization</h2>
      <p>Traditional personalization has relied on broad demographic segments and simple rules-based systems. A customer who purchased running shoes might receive generic emails about fitness products. But today's AI-powered systems analyze hundreds of data points in real-time - from browsing behavior and purchase history to contextual factors like weather and local events - to create dynamic, individualized experiences.</p>
      
      <p>The difference is profound. Rather than placing customers into predefined segments, modern AI systems understand each person's unique preferences, needs, and behaviors, then adapt accordingly.</p>

      <h2>The Digital Ecosystem Advantage</h2>
      <p>What's making this new level of personalization possible isn't just advances in AI, but the rise of interconnected digital ecosystems. Companies are breaking down data silos between channels, integrating first and third-party data sources, and creating unified customer profiles that capture the full spectrum of interactions.</p>
      
      <p>These ecosystems enable continuous learning, where each customer interaction provides feedback that improves future experiences. When a consumer engages with content, browses products, or makes a purchase, that information flows through the ecosystem and refines the personalization model in real-time.</p>

      <h2>Practical Applications Emerging Today</h2>
      <p>Forward-thinking organizations are already implementing segment-of-one strategies with impressive results:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Content Generation:</strong> AI systems that create unique content combinations tailored to individual preferences, rather than simply selecting from pre-written alternatives.</li>
        <li><strong>Predictive Customer Journeys:</strong> Platforms that anticipate needs and deliver relevant touchpoints before customers even express them.</li>
        <li><strong>Hyper-contextual Experiences:</strong> Applications that adjust based on immediate context - location, time, device, and even emotional state detected through interaction patterns.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Ethical Considerations and Privacy Balance</h2>
      <p>As personalization capabilities advance, so too must ethical frameworks for their deployment. The most successful implementations balance personalization with privacy, ensuring transparency about data usage and providing meaningful control to consumers.</p>
      
      <p>Companies leading in this space recognize that personalization should feel helpful rather than invasive. They create clear value exchanges where consumers understand the benefits they receive in exchange for sharing their data.</p>

      <h2>The Path Forward</h2>
      <p>Organizations looking to harness the power of segment-of-one personalization should focus on:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Building unified data foundations that connect customer information across touchpoints</li>
        <li>Investing in AI capabilities that can process and act on this data in real-time</li>
        <li>Creating flexible content systems designed for dynamic personalization</li>
        <li>Establishing clear ethical guidelines and privacy controls</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The convergence of AI and digital ecosystems has finally made the segment-of-one vision achievable. Organizations that thoughtfully implement these capabilities will create deeper customer relationships, drive greater engagement, and ultimately achieve sustainable competitive advantage in an increasingly personalized world.</p>
